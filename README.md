### Components

- Gameover : Person should avoid fire blocks. When person collides with fire, player will lose 1 ðŸ’–. If player loses all ðŸ’–, it is gameover.
- Get score : If a fire block goes out of the game board, player gets 1 score.
- Stage up : Whenever player gets 10 score, player moves on to the next stage. The higher the stage, the faster the block movement.
