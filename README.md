It is Web Minigame. (Sejong Univ. Web Programming Group Project)

### Components

There are 2 Type of blocks

- **person** : yellow
- **fire** : red, purple

### Rule

- Gameover : Person should avoid fire blocks. When person collides with fire, player will lose 1 💖. If player loses all 💖, it is gameover.
- Get score : If a fire block goes out of the game board, player gets 1 score.
- Stage up : Whenever player gets 10 score, player moves on to the next stage. The higher the stage, the faster the block movement.
